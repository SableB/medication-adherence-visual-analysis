# Medication Adherence Visual Analysis

👋 Hi! This is my very first portfolio project, and I’m super proud to take this step in showcasing my data skills.

## 🧠 About the Project
This project explores how patients with conditions like diabetes and hypertension adhere to their prescribed medications — and how those behaviors affect healthcare plan costs.

I focused on identifying which demographics are more or less likely to follow their medication plans, and visualized how non-adherence can lead to higher financial burdens.

## 💻 What I Did
- Cleaned and transformed the raw dataset (renamed columns, fixed values, improved readability)
- Built visualizations that tell a compelling story about patient behavior
- Explored trends across age, gender, and financial contribution
- Highlighted key insights for potential targeted intervention

## 📊 Tools Used
- IBM Cognos Analytics
- Microsoft Excel
- Canva

## 📈 Key Findings
- Young adults and the elderly showed the highest rates of non-adherence
- Non-adherent patients often took more medication than prescribed
- This group also had higher annual healthcare contributions and claims
- Male patients aged 50–60 carried the highest financial burden
