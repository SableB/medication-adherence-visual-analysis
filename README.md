## 🧠 About the Project
This analysis explores how patients with diabetes and hypertension adhere to their prescribed medications — and how that impacts healthcare plan costs. I focused on understanding which demographics are more or less likely to follow their medication plans.

## 💼 What I Did
- Cleaned and transformed raw data (renamed columns, refined values)
- Created insightful visuals to highlight behavioral and financial trends
- Explored patterns by gender, age, and annual contribution/claim amounts

## 🛠 Tools Used
- IBM Cognos Analytics
- Microsoft Excel
- Canva

## 📈 Key Findings
- Non-adherence is most common among young adults and elderly patients
- These groups took more medication than prescribed and had higher claims
- Males aged 50–60 had the highest financial impact across all groups
